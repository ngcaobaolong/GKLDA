		<Tokens>Got the Sony DCS-TX10 last week , have not tried under water yet but have the following observations : Positives : - Much quicker focusing than D10 - Wide angle starts at 25mm vs 35mm for D10 - Awesome HD movie mode with zoom support and stereo sound - Good punchy pictures with accurate colors - Very compact - Image stabilization very good - Sweep panorama is useful and fun - Sliding cover protects lens Negatives : - It takes a few seconds from power on until first shot - Takes 5-7 seconds to start recording a movie if not in movie mode -- This is very annoying , maybe it can be fixed via future firmware update ?</Tokens>
