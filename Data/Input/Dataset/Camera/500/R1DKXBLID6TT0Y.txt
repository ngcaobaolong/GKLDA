		<Tokens>Update : I returned the camera , just to many issues to tolerate for $ 1k price tag : - inconsistent exposure with built-in flash with still subject - random lockups , sometimes camera would n't turn on , sometimes it would n't turn off - custom WB does not work indoors at all , get error every time - AF errors in movie mode with sony 55-200 lens , camera would start loosing focus all over the sudden when filming a still subject - noise is really big issue for this sensor , iso 1600 is barely usable for indoors - pictures are less sharp with a65 vs a55 shot with same lens I would rather see Sony giving us bigger sensor at affordable price put into SLT bodies then keep adding pixels to APS-C .</Tokens>
