		<Tokens>the camera is amazing i use it mostly for cinematography and time lapses and it more than gets the job done to compare to a nikon at the same price would be a waste of my time because a D7000 does n't match it and is more expensive i have used a 7D a lot i think they are pretty equal in most areas the things that make the 7D better have no purpose to me i would take the flip out screen for better angles over a magnesium body i like the 7D but not worth 500 more dollars to me .</Tokens>
